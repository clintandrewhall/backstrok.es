Answering questions about our Social Media footprints.

I use Foursquare for a number of reasons, but one of my favorites is to keep track of places I go when I'm in a new city.This facet organizes Foursquare check-ins into "trips" of sequential check-ins that took place outside a "home" ZIP code.

No data is ever stored anywhere. There is no database. Each time you Backstroke, I query the relevant services.

Hi, I'm Clint. I use the cloud.

This is a collection of answers to questions I've asked about my data that the services I use don't necessarily answer.

Give it try! Do you have feedback or questions you'd want answered?
